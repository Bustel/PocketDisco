# PocketDisco 

Have you ever wondered how you could have a "Silent Disco" party at your own 
home? No? Well, we did and that's why we made this. PocketDisco will record your
local audio streams and setup a local web server from which you can stream your
audio to every device with a browser. All streams to the clients are 
**synchronized** so you can safely sing along to the lyrics together.    

So, start the server, choose your favourite Spotify/Google Music/Amazon Music
/whatever playlist and tell your friends to bring their phones and headphones. 
That's it. 

## Requirements
